This repository is meant to be a collection of tool to handle the latex creation of exercise
sheets during the semester. The idea behind is that, once set up everything according to the
explaination below, the exercise sheet can be produced using the main bash handler of this
repository, straightforwardly interacting with it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PREREQUISITES:

1) Template file with required informations filled out. The script will look for it at
   each run and it will use the information in it contained. If this file is not found,
   like the first time you will run the script, an empty template is created in the 
   folder from which the main script is run. Please open it and fill it out. If this file
   is not filled out properly, you will be warned in the successive runs.
   You will see some blocks (PACKAGES, DEFINITIONS and BODY). They can be used to add
   information that has to be used for all the exercises! Read the EXERCISE FORMAT section
   to know more about them.

2) A pool of exercises. This has to be a separate folder in which all the exercise are
   collected. Read the section EXERCISE FORMAT below to know more about it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

MAIN SCRIPT FUNCTIONALITIES

The script has a helper that can be obtained using the -h (or --help) option and which
already provides a lot of information. Please refer to it. Running the script without
any option, you will obtain a list of exercises to choose among and you can pick up those
that you wish to put in the exercise sheet.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

EXERCISE FORMAT

An exercise sheet is divided in three blocks: PACKAGES, DEFINITIONS and BODY. Each of them
is marked by a begin and end guards that look like

%__BEGIN_<BLOCK_NAME>__%
%__END_<BLOCK_NAME>__%

and has to be used for a different purpose. The PACKAGES and DEFINITIONS blocks shall
contain latex directives to include packages or to define new commands, while the BODY block
is meant to contain material that will be put in the document environment of the final latex
file. In the template file described above in PREREQUISITES, the same three blocks are present
and shall be used in the same way, with the only difference that they will be in common to all
the sheets produced. In fact, the main tex file will contain (together with some other
necessary code):

    1) PACKAGES    block of template
    2) PACKAGES    block of exercises (in the order as they have been chosen)
    3) DEFINITIONS block of template
    4) DEFINITIONS block of exercises (in the order as they have been chosen)
    5) BODY        block of template
    6) BODY        block of exercises (in the order as they have been chosen)
    
exactly in this order. Clearly this can lead to conflicts and errors in the final compilation,
since the same package can be loaded several times and/or the same command can be defined
more than once. At the moment it is responsability of the user to avoid such a conflicts (a
suggestion could be to use just the template file, even though this will lead to many unused
commands in most of the sheets). Note that any block can be left empty, but it should not be
deleted or modified (otherwise the script could stop to work).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FUTURE PLANS

1) Improve packages/commands handling!
2) Deal with different latex styles, creating an option to pick one.

DISCLAIMER

1) This script has been developed under Linux and it is intended for it. On MacOS some changes
   will probably be needed in order to use it.
