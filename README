This repository is meant to be a collection of tool to handle the latex creation of exercise
sheets during the semester. The idea behind is that, once set up everything according to the
explaination below, the exercise sheet can be produced using the main bash handler of this
repository, straightforwardly interacting with it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PREREQUISITES:

1) Template file with required informations filled out. The script will look for it at
   each run and it will use the information in it contained. If this file is not found,
   like the first time you will run the script, an empty template is created in the 
   folder from which the main script is run. Please open and fill it out. If this file
   is not filled out properly, you will be warned in the successive runs.

2) A pool of exercises. This has to be a separate folder in which all the exercise are
   collected. Read the section EXERCISE FORMAT below to know more about it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

MAIN SCRIPT FUNCTIONALITIES

The script has a helper that can be obtained using the -h (or --help) option and which
already provides a lot of information. Please refer to it. Here we summarize the main
tasks that the script can achieve.

1) Create an exercise sheet. This is the main and default task. Running the script without
   any option, you will obtain a list of exercises to choose among and you can pick up those
   that you wish to put in the exercise sheet.

2) Create a TeX standalone file with one (or more) exercises. In this case no pdf will
   be produced and you will obtain a .tex file that you can use, for instance, to share
   it with someone else.

FUTURE PLANS:

Deal with different styles, creating an option to pick one.
