This file is intended to keep track of work that should be done in the future,
trying to classify it according to priority.

HIGH PRIORITY:

 - Decide how to handle the production of exercise solutions that might not be there when the
   script is run with the --final option for the exercise sheet production
 - Add option to produce presence sheet, with columns associated to each exercise.
   Base construction of this sheet on .log file of final sheet and think about having
   options to add remark column or to hide exercise columns. This sheet could be used
   to gather signatures in tutorials (without exercise columns) or to make student
   auto-evaluate (without signature column) or to do both.

NORMAL PRIORITY:

 - Give the possibility to the user to create her/his own theme. Implement option
   to abilitate this and pass the file. This should contain the needed commands
   (\Heading, etc.) and it should be input in the main tex file. Add description
   to README file where commands to be provided should be listed. Decide whether we
   expect to get the full path to the custom theme as an argument to the command line
   option, or we use a field in localdefs for the path and the command line option to
   just pass the name (useful also if we will ever have a folder with many available themes).

LOW PRIORITY:

 - Trap CTRL-C in a nice way: cleaning files/folders. etc. -> DESIGN
