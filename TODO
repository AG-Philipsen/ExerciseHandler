This file is intended to keep track of work that should be done in the future,
trying to classify it according to priority.

HIGH PRIORITY:

NORMAL PRIORITY:

LOW PRIORITY:

 - Trap CTRL-C in a nice way: cleaning files/folders. etc. -> DESIGN
 - Use consistent exit error codes (now they are hard coded and without a meaning)
 - Is it worth to make the handler fill the optional latex argument of the solution
   environment if empty, reading it from the corresponding exercise?
 - Refactor the LaTeX theme in order to give much more freedom to the user.
    * Each sheet should have a own \Head and a \Sheet command
    * In the classic theme, where we use the same \Head across all sheets,
      we can implement an internal \genericHead command and use it in
      all the provided \nameHead commands.
 - Use consistently quotation marks, in particular in filenames -> consider possible spaces
   in filenames?!
 - Use only printf, no echo.
 - Implement more pedantic check on localdefs file to check that commands that should be there
   are indeed there?!
 - Use TikZ to "draw" tables instead of pgfplotstable?! This would solve the single line table
   exam problem, but it should be checked if all functionality can be guaranteed.
 - Implement way to switch to different LaTeX compiler.
 - Implement reordering of packages according to known rules?
