This file is intended to keep track of work that should be done in the future,
trying to classify it according to priority.

HIGH PRIORITY:

 - Refactor command line helper in order to print secondary options after the mutually
   exclusive ones. Implement some logic to forbid using strange combinations of options.
   Write a short preface to the list of option in the helper.

 - Implement -X option.

NORMAL PRIORITY:

 - At the moment, if the fix final option is given, we remove the final folder and recreate it.
   However, if the user forgot to close a file in that folder, the rm -r command fail and the script
   aborts. This is bad, because usually the rm -r command will have already deleted partially
   the final folder! A workaround for the user is to recreate the final sheet in this case, but
   it is not so friendly. It would be nice if the handler would take care of this situation.
   -> Think about a possible solution. Have a look to "lsof +D DIR" command.

 - Give the possibility to the user to create her/his own theme. Implement option
   to abilitate this and pass the file. This should contain the needed commands
   (\Heading, etc.) and it should be input in the main tex file. Add description
   to README file where commands to be provided should be listed. Decide whether we
   expect to get the full path to the custom theme as an argument to the command line
   option, or we use a field in localdefs for the path and the command line option to
   just pass the name (useful also if we will ever have a folder with many available themes).

LOW PRIORITY:

 - Trap CTRL-C in a nice way: cleaning files/folders. etc. -> DESIGN
 - Use consistent exit error codes (now they are hard coded and without a meaning)
 - Is it worth to make the handler fill the optional latex argument of the solution
   environment if empty, reading it from the corresponding exercise?
